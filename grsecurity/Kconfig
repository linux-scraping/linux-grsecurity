config GRKERNSEC_KMEM
	bool "Deny reading/writing to /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, and /dev/port"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	select STRICT_DEVMEM if (X86 || ARM || TILE || S390)
	help
	  If you say Y here, /dev/kmem and /dev/mem won't be allowed to
	  be written to or read from to modify or leak the contents of the running
	  kernel.  /dev/port will also not be allowed to be opened. If you have module
	  support disabled, enabling this will close up four ways that are
	  currently used  to insert malicious code into the running kernel.
	  Even with all these features enabled, we still highly recommend that
	  you use the RBAC system, as it is still possible for an attacker to
	  modify the running kernel through privileged I/O granted by ioperm/iopl.
	  If you are not using XFree86, you may be able to stop this additional
	  case by enabling the 'Disable privileged I/O' option. Though nothing
	  legitimately writes to /dev/kmem, XFree86 does need to write to /dev/mem,
	  but only to video memory, which is the only writing we allow in this
	  case.  If /dev/kmem or /dev/mem are mmaped without PROT_WRITE, they will
	  not be allowed to mprotect it with PROT_WRITE later.
	  It is highly recommended that you say Y here if you meet all the
	  conditions above.

config GRKERNSEC_VM86
	bool "Restrict VM86 mode"

	help
	  If you say Y here, only processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will be able to
	  make use of a special execution mode on 32bit x86 processors called
	  Virtual 8086 (VM86) mode.  XFree86 may need vm86 mode for certain
	  video cards and will still work with this option enabled.  The purpose
	  of the option is to prevent exploitation of emulation errors in
	  virtualization of vm86 mode like the one discovered in VMWare in 2009.
	  Nearly all users should be able to enable this option.

config GRKERNSEC_IO

	select RTC_DRV_CMOS

	help
	  If you say Y here, all ioperm and iopl calls will return an error.
	  Ioperm and iopl can be used to modify the running kernel.
	  Unfortunately, some programs need this access to operate properly,
	  the most notable of which are XFree86 and hwclock.  hwclock can be
	  remedied by having RTC support in the kernel, so real-time 
	  clock support is enabled if this option is enabled, to ensure 
	  that hwclock operates correctly.  XFree86 still will not 
	  operate correctly with this option enabled, so DO NOT CHOOSE Y 
	  IF YOU USE XFree86.  If you use XFree86 and you still want to 
	  protect your kernel against modification, use the RBAC system.

config GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP
	bool "Harden ASLR against information leaks and entropy reduction"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO || PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR)
	depends on PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR
	help
	  If you say Y here, the /proc/<pid>/maps and /proc/<pid>/stat files will
	  give no information about the addresses of its mappings if
	  PaX features that rely on random addresses are enabled on the task.
	  In addition to sanitizing this information and disabling other
	  dangerous sources of information, this option causes reads of sensitive
	  /proc/<pid> entries where the file descriptor was opened in a different
	  task than the one performing the read.  Such attempts are logged.
	  This option also limits argv/env strings for suid/sgid binaries
	  to 512KB to prevent a complete exhaustion of the stack entropy provided
	  by ASLR.  Finally, it places an 8MB stack resource limit on suid/sgid
	  binaries to prevent alternative mmap layouts from being abused.

	  If you use PaX it is essential that you say Y here as it closes up
	  several holes that make full ASLR useless locally.

config GRKERNSEC_BRUTE
	bool "Deter exploit bruteforcing"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	help
	  If you say Y here, attempts to bruteforce exploits against forking
	  daemons such as apache or sshd, as well as against suid/sgid binaries
	  will be deterred.  When a child of a forking daemon is killed by PaX
	  or crashes due to an illegal instruction or other suspicious signal,
	  the parent process will be delayed 30 seconds upon every subsequent
	  fork until the administrator is able to assess the situation and
	  restart the daemon.
	  In the suid/sgid case, the attempt is logged, the user has all their
	  processes terminated, and they are prevented from executing any further
	  processes for 15 minutes.
	  It is recommended that you also enable signal logging in the auditing
	  section so that logs are generated when a process triggers a suspicious
	  signal.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "deter_bruteforce" is created.


config GRKERNSEC_MODHARDEN
	bool "Harden module auto-loading"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  If you say Y here, module auto-loading in response to use of some
	  feature implemented by an unloaded module will be restricted to
	  root users.  Enabling this option helps defend against attacks 
	  by unprivileged users who abuse the auto-loading behavior to 
	  cause a vulnerable module to load that is then exploited.

	  If this option prevents a legitimate use of auto-loading for a 
	  non-root user, the administrator can execute modprobe manually 
	  with the exact name of the module mentioned in the alert log.
	  Alternatively, the administrator can add the module to the list
	  of modules loaded at boot by modifying init scripts.

	  Modification of init scripts will most likely be needed on 
	  Ubuntu servers with encrypted home directory support enabled,
	  as the first non-root user logging in will cause the ecb(aes),
	  ecb(aes)-all, cbc(aes), and cbc(aes)-all  modules to be loaded.

config GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM
	bool "Hide kernel symbols"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	select PAX_USERCOPY_SLABS
	help
	  If you say Y here, getting information on loaded modules, and
	  displaying all kernel symbols through a syscall will be restricted
	  to users with CAP_SYS_MODULE.  For software compatibility reasons,
	  /proc/kallsyms will be restricted to the root user.  The RBAC
	  system can hide that entry even from root.

	  This option also prevents leaking of kernel addresses through
	  several /proc entries.

	  Note that this option is only effective provided the following
	  conditions are met:
	  1) The kernel using grsecurity is not precompiled by some distribution
	  2) You have also enabled GRKERNSEC_DMESG
	  3) You are using the RBAC system and hiding other files such as your
	     kernel image and System.map.  Alternatively, enabling this option
	     causes the permissions on /boot, /lib/modules, and the kernel
	     source directory to change at compile time to prevent 
	     reading by non-root users.
	  If the above conditions are met, this option will aid in providing a
	  useful protection against local kernel exploitation of overflows
	  and arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities.

config GRKERNSEC_KERN_LOCKOUT
	bool "Active kernel exploit response"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on X86 || ARM || PPC || SPARC
	help
	  If you say Y here, when a PaX alert is triggered due to suspicious
	  activity in the kernel (from KERNEXEC/UDEREF/USERCOPY)
	  or an OOPS occurs due to bad memory accesses, instead of just
	  terminating the offending process (and potentially allowing
	  a subsequent exploit from the same user), we will take one of two
	  actions:
	   If the user was root, we will panic the system
	   If the user was non-root, we will log the attempt, terminate
	   all processes owned by the user, then prevent them from creating
	   any new processes until the system is restarted
	  This deters repeated kernel exploitation/bruteforcing attempts
	  and is useful for later forensics.

	  If you say Y here, the /dev/grsec device will be removed from the kernel,
	  preventing the RBAC system from being enabled.  You should only say Y
	  here if you have no intention of using the RBAC system, so as to prevent
	  an attacker with root access from misusing the RBAC system to hide files

	  denied the ability to attempt authorization again for a specified time.
	  The lower the number, the harder it will be to brute-force a password.

config GRKERNSEC_ACL_TIMEOUT

	  will be altered to enhance system security and privacy.  You MUST
  	  choose either a user only restriction or a user and group restriction.
	  Depending upon the option you choose, you can either restrict users to
	  see only the processes they themselves run, or choose a group that can
	  view all processes and files normally restricted to root if you choose
	  the "restrict to user only" option.  NOTE: If you're running identd or

          enabled GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM, kernel and symbol information may still

config GRKERNSEC_LINK

	  If you say Y here, /tmp race exploits will be prevented, since users
	  will no longer be able to follow symlinks owned by other users in
	  world-writable +t directories (e.g. /tmp), unless the owner of the
	  symlink is the owner of the directory. users will also not be

config GRKERNSEC_SYMLINKOWN
	bool "Kernel-enforced SymlinksIfOwnerMatch"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER
	help
	  Apache's SymlinksIfOwnerMatch option has an inherent race condition
	  that prevents it from being used as a security feature.  As Apache
	  verifies the symlink by performing a stat() against the target of
	  the symlink before it is followed, an attacker can setup a symlink
	  to point to a same-owned file, then replace the symlink with one
	  that targets another user's file just after Apache "validates" the
	  symlink -- a classic TOCTOU race.  If you say Y here, a complete,
	  race-free replacement for Apache's "SymlinksIfOwnerMatch" option
	  will be in place for the group you specify. If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "enforce_symlinksifowner" is

config GRKERNSEC_SYSFS_RESTRICT
	bool "Sysfs/debugfs restriction"
	default y if (GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO && GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_SERVER)
	depends on SYSFS
	help
	  If you say Y here, sysfs (the pseudo-filesystem mounted at /sys) and
	  any filesystem normally mounted under it (e.g. debugfs) will be
	  mostly accessible only by root.  These filesystems generally provide access
	  to hardware and debug information that isn't appropriate for unprivileged
	  users of the system.  Sysfs and debugfs have also become a large source
	  of new vulnerabilities, ranging from infoleaks to local compromise.
	  There has been very little oversight with an eye toward security involved
	  in adding new exporters of information to these filesystems, so their
	  use is discouraged.
	  For reasons of compatibility, a few directories have been whitelisted
	  for access by non-root users:
	  /sys/fs/selinux
	  /sys/fs/fuse
	  /sys/devices/system/cpu

config GRKERNSEC_ROFS
	bool "Runtime read-only mount protection"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a sysctl option with name "romount_protect" will
	  be created.  By setting this option to 1 at runtime, filesystems
	  will be protected in the following ways:
	  * No new writable mounts will be allowed
	  * Existing read-only mounts won't be able to be remounted read/write
	  * Write operations will be denied on all block devices
	  This option acts independently of grsec_lock: once it is set to 1,
	  it cannot be turned off.  Therefore, please be mindful of the resulting
	  behavior if this option is enabled in an init script on a read-only
	  filesystem.  This feature is mainly intended for secure embedded systems.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT

	  is recommended that you enable each one.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MOUNT
	bool "Deny mounts"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_DOUBLE
	bool "Deny double-chroots"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chroot
	  again outside the chroot.  This is a widely used method of breaking
	  out of a chroot jail and should not be allowed.  If the sysctl 
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
	  "chroot_deny_chroot" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_PIVOT
	bool "Deny pivot_root in chroot"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to use
	  a function called pivot_root() that was introduced in Linux 2.3.41.  It
	  works similar to chroot in that it changes the root filesystem.  This
	  function could be misused in a chrooted process to attempt to break out
	  of the chroot, and therefore should not be allowed.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_pivot" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHDIR
	bool "Enforce chdir(\"/\") on all chroots"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, the current working directory of all newly-chrooted
	  applications will be set to the the root directory of the chroot.
	  The man page on chroot(2) states:
	  Note that this call does not change  the  current  working
	  directory,  so  that `.' can be outside the tree rooted at
	  `/'.  In particular, the  super-user  can  escape  from  a
	  `chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.

	  It is recommended that you say Y here, since it's not known to break
	  any software.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
	  name "chroot_enforce_chdir" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD
	bool "Deny (f)chmod +s"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chmod
	  or fchmod files to make them have suid or sgid bits.  This protects
	  against another published method of breaking a chroot.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_chmod" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FCHDIR
	bool "Deny fchdir out of chroot"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, a well-known method of breaking chroots by fchdir'ing
	  to a file descriptor of the chrooting process that points to a directory
	  outside the filesystem will be stopped.  If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_fchdir" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MKNOD
	bool "Deny mknod"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be allowed to
	  mknod.  The problem with using mknod inside a chroot is that it
	  would allow an attacker to create a device entry that is the same
	  as one on the physical root of your system, which could range from
	  anything from the console device to a device for your harddrive (which
	  they could then use to wipe the drive or steal data).  It is recommended
	  that you say Y here, unless you run into software incompatibilities.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "chroot_deny_mknod" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SHMAT
	bool "Deny shmat() out of chroot"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to attach
	  to shared memory segments that were created outside of the chroot jail.
	  It is recommended that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled,
	  a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_shmat" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_UNIX

	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
	  connect to abstract (meaning not belonging to a filesystem) Unix
	  domain sockets that were bound outside of a chroot.  It is recommended
	  that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "chroot_deny_unix" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FINDTASK
	bool "Protect outside processes"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
	  kill, send signals with fcntl, ptrace, capget, getpgid, setpgid, 
	  getsid, or view any process outside of the chroot.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_findtask" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_NICE
	bool "Restrict priority changes"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to raise
	  the priority of processes in the chroot, or alter the priority of
	  processes outside the chroot.  This provides more security than simply
	  removing CAP_SYS_NICE from the process' capability set.  If the
	  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_restrict_nice"
	  is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SYSCTL
	bool "Deny sysctl writes"
	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO

	default y if GRKERNSEC_CONFIG_AUTO
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT

	  If you say Y here, the capabilities on all processes within a
	  chroot jail will be lowered to stop module insertion, raw i/o,
	  system and net admin tasks, rebooting the system, modifying immutable
	  files, modifying IPC owned by another, and changing the system time.
	  This is left an option because it can break some apps.  Disable this
	  if your chrooted apps are having problems performing those kinds of

	  If you say Y here, the entropy pools used for many features of Linux

config GRKERNSEC_BLACKHOLE

	depends on NET
	help
	  If you say Y here, neither TCP resets nor ICMP
	  destination-unreachable packets will be sent in response to packets
	  sent to ports for which no associated listening process exists.
	  This feature supports both IPV4 and IPV6 and exempts the 
	  loopback interface from blackholing.  Enabling this feature 
	  makes a host more resilient to DoS attacks and reduces network
	  visibility against scanners.

	  The blackhole feature as-implemented is equivalent to the FreeBSD
	  blackhole feature, as it prevents RST responses to all packets, not
	  just SYNs.  Under most application behavior this causes no
	  problems, but applications (like haproxy) may not close certain
	  connections in a way that cleanly terminates them on the remote
	  end, leaving the remote host in LAST_ACK state.  Because of this
	  side-effect and to prevent intentional LAST_ACK DoSes, this
	  feature also adds automatic mitigation against such attacks.
	  The mitigation drastically reduces the amount of time a socket
	  can spend in LAST_ACK state.  If you're using haproxy and not
	  all servers it connects to have this option enabled, consider
	  disabling this feature on the haproxy host.

	  If the sysctl option is enabled, two sysctl options with names
	  "ip_blackhole" and "lastack_retries" will be created.
	  While "ip_blackhole" takes the standard zero/non-zero on/off
	  toggle, "lastack_retries" uses the same kinds of values as
	  "tcp_retries1" and "tcp_retries2".  The default value of 4
	  prevents a socket from lasting more than 45 seconds in LAST_ACK
	  state.
