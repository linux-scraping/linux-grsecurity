	help
	  If you say Y here, many of the features of grsecurity will be
	  enabled, which will protect you against many kinds of attacks
	  against your system.  The heightened security comes at a cost
	  of an increased chance of incompatibilities with rare software
	  on your machine.  Since this security level enables PaX, you should
	  view <http://pax.grsecurity.net> and read about the PaX
	  project.  While you are there, download chpax and run it on
	  binaries that cause problems with PaX.  Also remember that
	  since the /proc restrictions are enabled, you must run your
	  identd as gid 1001.  This security level enables the following 
	  features in addition to those listed in the low and medium 
	  security levels:

	  - Additional /proc restrictions
	  - Chmod restrictions in chroot
	  - No signals, ptrace, or viewing of processes outside of chroot
	  - Capability restrictions in chroot
	  - Deny fchdir out of chroot
	  - Priority restrictions in chroot
	  - Segmentation-based implementation of PaX
	  - Mprotect restrictions
	  - Removal of addresses from /proc/<pid>/[smaps|maps|stat]
	  - Kernel stack randomization
	  - Mount/unmount/remount logging
	  - Kernel symbol hiding
	  - Prevention of memory exhaustion-based exploits
	  - Hardening of module auto-loading
	  - Ptrace restrictions
	  - Restricted vm86 mode

config GRKERNSEC_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to configure every grsecurity
	  option, which allows you to enable many more features that aren't
	  covered in the basic security levels.  These additional features
	  include TPE, socket restrictions, and the sysctl system for
	  grsecurity.  It is advised that you read through the help for
	  each option to determine its usefulness in your situation.

config GRKERNSEC_KMEM
	bool "Deny writing to /dev/kmem, /dev/mem, and /dev/port"
	help
	  If you say Y here, /dev/kmem and /dev/mem won't be allowed to
	  be written to via mmap or otherwise to modify the running kernel.
	  /dev/port will also not be allowed to be opened. If you have module
	  support disabled, enabling this will close up four ways that are
	  currently used  to insert malicious code into the running kernel.
	  Even with all these features enabled, we still highly recommend that
	  you use the RBAC system, as it is still possible for an attacker to
	  modify the running kernel through privileged I/O granted by ioperm/iopl.
	  If you are not using XFree86, you may be able to stop this additional
	  case by enabling the 'Disable privileged I/O' option. Though nothing
	  legitimately writes to /dev/kmem, XFree86 does need to write to /dev/mem,
	  but only to video memory, which is the only writing we allow in this
	  case.  If /dev/kmem or /dev/mem are mmaped without PROT_WRITE, they will
	  not be allowed to mprotect it with PROT_WRITE later.
	  It is highly recommended that you say Y here if you meet all the
	  conditions above.

config GRKERNSEC_VM86
	bool "Restrict VM86 mode"
	depends on X86_32

	help
	  If you say Y here, only processes with CAP_SYS_RAWIO will be able to
	  make use of a special execution mode on 32bit x86 processors called
	  Virtual 8086 (VM86) mode.  XFree86 may need vm86 mode for certain
	  video cards and will still work with this option enabled.  The purpose
	  of the option is to prevent exploitation of emulation errors in
	  virtualization of vm86 mode like the one discovered in VMWare in 2009.
	  Nearly all users should be able to enable this option.

config GRKERNSEC_IO
	bool "Disable privileged I/O"
	depends on X86
	select RTC_CLASS
	select RTC_INTF_DEV
	select RTC_DRV_CMOS

	help
	  If you say Y here, all ioperm and iopl calls will return an error.
	  Ioperm and iopl can be used to modify the running kernel.
	  Unfortunately, some programs need this access to operate properly,
	  the most notable of which are XFree86 and hwclock.  hwclock can be
	  remedied by having RTC support in the kernel, so real-time 
	  clock support is enabled if this option is enabled, to ensure 
	  that hwclock operates correctly.  XFree86 still will not 
	  operate correctly with this option enabled, so DO NOT CHOOSE Y 
	  IF YOU USE XFree86.  If you use XFree86 and you still want to 
	  protect your kernel against modification, use the RBAC system.

config GRKERNSEC_PROC_MEMMAP
	bool "Remove addresses from /proc/<pid>/[smaps|maps|stat]"
	default y if (PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR)
	depends on PAX_NOEXEC || PAX_ASLR
	help
	  If you say Y here, the /proc/<pid>/maps and /proc/<pid>/stat files will
	  give no information about the addresses of its mappings if
	  PaX features that rely on random addresses are enabled on the task.
	  If you use PaX it is greatly recommended that you say Y here as it
	  closes up a hole that makes the full ASLR useless for suid
	  binaries.

config GRKERNSEC_BRUTE
	bool "Deter exploit bruteforcing"
	help
	  If you say Y here, attempts to bruteforce exploits against forking
	  daemons such as apache or sshd will be deterred.  When a child of a
	  forking daemon is killed by PaX or crashes due to an illegal
	  instruction, the parent process will be delayed 30 seconds upon every
	  subsequent fork until the administrator is able to assess the
	  situation and restart the daemon.  It is recommended that you also
	  enable signal logging in the auditing section so that logs are
	  generated when a process performs an illegal instruction.

config GRKERNSEC_MODHARDEN
	bool "Harden module auto-loading"
	depends on MODULES
	help
	  If you say Y here, module auto-loading in response to use of some
	  feature implemented by an unloaded module will be restricted to
	  root users.  Enabling this option helps defend against attacks 
	  by unprivileged users who abuse the auto-loading behavior to 
	  cause a vulnerable module to load that is then exploited.

	  If this option prevents a legitimate use of auto-loading for a 
	  non-root user, the administrator can execute modprobe manually 
	  with the exact name of the module mentioned in the alert log.
	  Alternatively, the administrator can add the module to the list
	  of modules loaded at boot by modifying init scripts.

	  Modification of init scripts will most likely be needed on 
	  Ubuntu servers with encrypted home directory support enabled,
	  as the first non-root user logging in will cause the ecb(aes),
	  ecb(aes)-all, cbc(aes), and cbc(aes)-all  modules to be loaded.

config GRKERNSEC_HIDESYM
	bool "Hide kernel symbols"
	help
	  If you say Y here, getting information on loaded modules, and
	  displaying all kernel symbols through a syscall will be restricted
	  to users with CAP_SYS_MODULE.  For software compatibility reasons,
	  /proc/kallsyms will be restricted to the root user.  The RBAC
	  system can hide that entry even from root.  Note that this option
	  is only effective provided the following conditions are met:
	  1) The kernel using grsecurity is not precompiled by some distribution
	  2) You are using the RBAC system and hiding other files such as your
	     kernel image and System.map.  Alternatively, enabling this option
	     causes the permissions on /boot, /lib/modules, and the kernel
	     source directory to change at compile time to prevent 
	     reading by non-root users.
	  If the above conditions are met, this option will aid in providing a
	  useful protection against local kernel exploitation of overflows
	  and arbitrary read/write vulnerabilities.

config GRKERNSEC_NO_RBAC
	bool "Disable RBAC system"
	help
	  If you say Y here, the /dev/grsec device will be removed from the kernel,
	  preventing the RBAC system from being enabled.  You should only say Y
	  here if you have no intention of using the RBAC system, so as to prevent
	  an attacker with root access from misusing the RBAC system to hide files
	  and processes when loadable module support and /dev/[k]mem have been
	  locked down.

config GRKERNSEC_ACL_HIDEKERN
	bool "Hide kernel processes"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all kernel threads will be hidden to all
	  processes but those whose subject has the "view hidden processes"
	  flag.

config GRKERNSEC_ACL_MAXTRIES
	int "Maximum tries before password lockout"
	default 3
	help
	  This option enforces the maximum number of times a user can attempt
	  to authorize themselves with the grsecurity RBAC system before being
	  denied the ability to attempt authorization again for a specified time.
	  The lower the number, the harder it will be to brute-force a password.

config GRKERNSEC_ACL_TIMEOUT
	int "Time to wait after max password tries, in seconds"
	default 30
	help
	  This option specifies the time the user must wait after attempting to
	  authorize to the RBAC system with the maximum number of invalid
	  passwords.  The higher the number, the harder it will be to brute-force
	  a password.

	  If you say Y here, the permissions of the /proc filesystem
	  will be altered to enhance system security and privacy.  You MUST
  	  choose either a user only restriction or a user and group restriction.
	  Depending upon the option you choose, you can either restrict users to
	  see only the processes they themselves run, or choose a group that can
	  view all processes and files normally restricted to root if you choose
	  the "restrict to user only" option.  NOTE: If you're running identd as

	  If you say Y here, additional restrictions will be placed on
	  /proc that keep normal users from viewing device information and 
	  slabinfo information that could be useful for exploits.

config GRKERNSEC_LINK
	bool "Linking restrictions"
	help
	  If you say Y here, /tmp race exploits will be prevented, since users
	  will no longer be able to follow symlinks owned by other users in
	  world-writable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of the
	  symlink is the owner of the directory. users will also not be
	  able to hardlink to files they do not own.  If the sysctl option is
	  enabled, a sysctl option with name "linking_restrictions" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_FIFO
	bool "FIFO restrictions"
	help
	  If you say Y here, users will not be able to write to FIFOs they don't
	  own in world-writable +t directories (i.e. /tmp), unless the owner of
	  the FIFO is the same owner of the directory it's held in.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "fifo_restrictions" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_ROFS
	bool "Runtime read-only mount protection"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a sysctl option with name "romount_protect" will
	  be created.  By setting this option to 1 at runtime, filesystems
	  will be protected in the following ways:
	  * No new writable mounts will be allowed
	  * Existing read-only mounts won't be able to be remounted read/write
	  * Write operations will be denied on all block devices
	  This option acts independently of grsec_lock: once it is set to 1,
	  it cannot be turned off.  Therefore, please be mindful of the resulting
	  behavior if this option is enabled in an init script on a read-only
	  filesystem.  This feature is mainly intended for secure embedded systems.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	bool "Chroot jail restrictions"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose several options that will
	  make breaking out of a chrooted jail much more difficult.  If you
	  encounter no software incompatibilities with the following options, it
	  is recommended that you enable each one.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MOUNT
	bool "Deny mounts"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
	  mount or remount filesystems.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
	  sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_mount" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_DOUBLE
	bool "Deny double-chroots"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chroot
	  again outside the chroot.  This is a widely used method of breaking
	  out of a chroot jail and should not be allowed.  If the sysctl 
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name 
	  "chroot_deny_chroot" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_PIVOT
	bool "Deny pivot_root in chroot"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to use
	  a function called pivot_root() that was introduced in Linux 2.3.41.  It
	  works similar to chroot in that it changes the root filesystem.  This
	  function could be misused in a chrooted process to attempt to break out
	  of the chroot, and therefore should not be allowed.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_pivot" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHDIR
	bool "Enforce chdir(\"/\") on all chroots"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, the current working directory of all newly-chrooted
	  applications will be set to the the root directory of the chroot.
	  The man page on chroot(2) states:
	  Note that this call does not change  the  current  working
	  directory,  so  that `.' can be outside the tree rooted at
	  `/'.  In particular, the  super-user  can  escape  from  a
	  `chroot jail' by doing `mkdir foo; chroot foo; cd ..'.

	  It is recommended that you say Y here, since it's not known to break
	  any software.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
	  name "chroot_enforce_chdir" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_CHMOD
	bool "Deny (f)chmod +s"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to chmod
	  or fchmod files to make them have suid or sgid bits.  This protects
	  against another published method of breaking a chroot.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_chmod" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FCHDIR
	bool "Deny fchdir out of chroot"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, a well-known method of breaking chroots by fchdir'ing
	  to a file descriptor of the chrooting process that points to a directory
	  outside the filesystem will be stopped.  If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_fchdir" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_MKNOD
	bool "Deny mknod"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be allowed to
	  mknod.  The problem with using mknod inside a chroot is that it
	  would allow an attacker to create a device entry that is the same
	  as one on the physical root of your system, which could range from
	  anything from the console device to a device for your harddrive (which
	  they could then use to wipe the drive or steal data).  It is recommended
	  that you say Y here, unless you run into software incompatibilities.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "chroot_deny_mknod" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SHMAT
	bool "Deny shmat() out of chroot"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to attach
	  to shared memory segments that were created outside of the chroot jail.
	  It is recommended that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled,
	  a sysctl option with name "chroot_deny_shmat" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_UNIX
	bool "Deny access to abstract AF_UNIX sockets out of chroot"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
	  connect to abstract (meaning not belonging to a filesystem) Unix
	  domain sockets that were bound outside of a chroot.  It is recommended
	  that you say Y here.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "chroot_deny_unix" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_FINDTASK
	bool "Protect outside processes"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to
	  kill, send signals with fcntl, ptrace, capget, getpgid, setpgid, 
	  getsid, or view any process outside of the chroot.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_findtask" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_NICE
	bool "Restrict priority changes"
	depends on GRKERNSEC_CHROOT
	help
	  If you say Y here, processes inside a chroot will not be able to raise
	  the priority of processes in the chroot, or alter the priority of
	  processes outside the chroot.  This provides more security than simply
	  removing CAP_SYS_NICE from the process' capability set.  If the
	  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "chroot_restrict_nice"
	  is created.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_SYSCTL

	help
	  If you say Y here, an attacker in a chroot will not be able to
	  write to sysctl entries, either by sysctl(2) or through a /proc

	  If you say Y here, the capabilities on all root processes within a
	  chroot jail will be lowered to stop module insertion, raw i/o,
	  system and net admin tasks, rebooting the system, modifying immutable
	  files, modifying IPC owned by another, and changing the system time.
	  This is left an option because it can break some apps.  Disable this
	  if your chrooted apps are having problems performing those kinds of
	  tasks.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
	  name "chroot_caps" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_EXECLOG
	bool "Exec logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all execve() calls will be logged (since the
	  other exec*() calls are frontends to execve(), all execution
	  will be logged).  Useful for shell-servers that like to keep track
	  of their users.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with
	  name "exec_logging" is created.
	  WARNING: This option when enabled will produce a LOT of logs, especially
	  on an active system.

config GRKERNSEC_RESLOG
	bool "Resource logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all attempts to overstep resource limits will
	  be logged with the resource name, the requested size, and the current
	  limit.  It is highly recommended that you say Y here.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "resource_logging" is
	  created.  If the RBAC system is enabled, the sysctl value is ignored.

config GRKERNSEC_CHROOT_EXECLOG
	bool "Log execs within chroot"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all executions inside a chroot jail will be logged
	  to syslog.  This can cause a large amount of logs if certain
	  applications (eg. djb's daemontools) are installed on the system, and
	  is therefore left as an option.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a
	  sysctl option with name "chroot_execlog" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_PTRACE
	bool "Ptrace logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all attempts to attach to a process via ptrace
	  will be logged.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "audit_ptrace" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_CHDIR
	bool "Chdir logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all chdir() calls will be logged.  If the sysctl
 	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "audit_chdir" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_MOUNT
	bool "(Un)Mount logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all mounts and unmounts will be logged.  If the
	  sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "audit_mount" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_SIGNAL
	bool "Signal logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, certain important signals will be logged, such as
	  SIGSEGV, which will as a result inform you of when a error in a program
	  occurred, which in some cases could mean a possible exploit attempt.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "signal_logging" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_FORKFAIL
	bool "Fork failure logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, all failed fork() attempts will be logged.
	  This could suggest a fork bomb, or someone attempting to overstep
	  their process limit.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option
	  with name "forkfail_logging" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_TIME
	bool "Time change logging"
	help
	  If you say Y here, any changes of the system clock will be logged.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name
	  "timechange_logging" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_PROC_IPADDR
	bool "/proc/<pid>/ipaddr support"
	help
	  If you say Y here, a new entry will be added to each /proc/<pid>
	  directory that contains the IP address of the person using the task.
	  The IP is carried across local TCP and AF_UNIX stream sockets.
	  This information can be useful for IDS/IPSes to perform remote response
	  to a local attack.  The entry is readable by only the owner of the
	  process (and root if he has CAP_DAC_OVERRIDE, which can be removed via
	  the RBAC system), and thus does not create privacy concerns.

config GRKERNSEC_AUDIT_TEXTREL
	bool 'ELF text relocations logging (READ HELP)'
	depends on PAX_MPROTECT
	help
	  If you say Y here, text relocations will be logged with the filename
	  of the offending library or binary.  The purpose of the feature is
	  to help Linux distribution developers get rid of libraries and
	  binaries that need text relocations which hinder the future progress
	  of PaX.  Only Linux distribution developers should say Y here, and
	  never on a production machine, as this option creates an information
	  leak that could aid an attacker in defeating the randomization of
	  a single memory region.  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl
	  option with name "audit_textrel" is created.

	help
	  If you say Y here, users with a resource limit on processes will
	  have the value checked during execve() calls.  The current system
	  only checks the system limit during fork() calls.  If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "execve_limiting" is created.

config GRKERNSEC_DMESG
	bool "Dmesg(8) restriction"
	help
	  If you say Y here, non-root users will not be able to use dmesg(8)
	  to view up to the last 4kb of messages in the kernel's log buffer.
	  If the sysctl option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "dmesg" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_HARDEN_PTRACE
	bool "Deter ptrace-based process snooping"
	help
	  If you say Y here, TTY sniffers and other malicious monitoring
	  programs implemented through ptrace will be defeated.  If you
	  have been using the RBAC system, this option has already been
	  enabled for several years for all users, with the ability to make
	  fine-grained exceptions.

	  This option only affects the ability of non-root users to ptrace
	  processes that are not a descendent of the ptracing process.
	  This means that strace ./binary and gdb ./binary will still work,
	  but attaching to arbitrary processes will not.  If the sysctl
	  option is enabled, a sysctl option with name "harden_ptrace" is
	  created.

config GRKERNSEC_TPE
	bool "Trusted Path Execution (TPE)"
	help
	  If you say Y here, you will be able to choose a gid to add to the
	  supplementary groups of users you want to mark as "untrusted."
	  These users will not be able to execute any files that are not in
	  root-owned directories writable only by root.  If the sysctl option
	  is enabled, a sysctl option with name "tpe" is created.

	help
	  If you say Y here, the entropy pools used for many features of Linux
	  and grsecurity will be doubled in size.  Since several grsecurity
	  features use additional randomness, it is recommended that you say Y
	  here.  Saying Y here has a similar effect as modifying
	  /proc/sys/kernel/random/poolsize.

config GRKERNSEC_BLACKHOLE
	bool "TCP/UDP blackhole"
	help
	  If you say Y here, neither TCP resets nor ICMP
	  destination-unreachable packets will be sent in response to packets
	  send to ports for which no associated listening process exists.
	  This feature supports both IPV4 and IPV6 and exempts the 
	  loopback interface from blackholing.  Enabling this feature 
	  makes a host more resilient to DoS attacks and reduces network
